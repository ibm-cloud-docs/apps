# Choosing your hosting environment
{: #hosting}

If you have an existing application, you can host it on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} with all the infrastructure or platform services you need.
{: shortdesc}

With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you no longer need to make large investments in hardware to test or run a new app. Instead, the infrastructure is managed for you, and you are only charged for what you use. Your cloud server environment is the base of your infrastructure layer. You can choose a single option or a combination for more complex environments. 

You have various options for hosting your apps, giving you as much control over the infrastructure as you want or need. You can run your app in any of the following ways:

* As a Docker container on a Kubernetes cluster
* As a serverless function
* As VMware&trade;
* As a virtual machine
* On high-performance {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} 

Check out the following table for a summary of your compute options.
