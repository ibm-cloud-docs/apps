# Creating serverless apps
{: #serverless}

For serverless development, you can use {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}, which is the IBM function-as-a-service (FaaS) offering. You can run application logic with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in response to events or direct invocations from web or mobile apps over HTTP without creating or managing servers. {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} performs system administration, such as availability management and maintenance so that you, as a developer, can focus on writing app logic.
{: shortdesc}

You can develop your serverless apps by using one of the following methods:
* {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} UI
* {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} command-line interface (CLI), which provides more control over your deployment and operations

For more detailed information about {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, check out these resources:
* [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} documentation](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-getting-started)
* [IBM Cloud Functions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions){: external}
* [FaaS (Function-as-a-Service)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/faas){: external}

## Developing with the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} UI
{: #serverless-apps-ui}

Try out {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in your [browser](/functions/actions){: external}. Go to the [Concepts](/functions/learn){: external} page for a quick tour of the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} UI.

## Developing with the CLI
{: #openwhisk_start_configure_cli}

To learn more about installing and developing with the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI, see [Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI](/functions/cli){: external}.

## Exposing APIs and data sets as web actions
{: #expose-actions}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} defines actions that require an authentication key. In production mobile environments, it is often necessary to authorize mobile clients based on OAuth flows to expose APIs and specific data sets.

With {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, you can expose your functions as web actions, which are annotated, to quickly build web-based apps. You can program back-end logic with annotated actions that your web app can access anonymously without requiring a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} authentication key.

To expose an action as a web action, go to the **Endpoints** tab of your action, and select **Enable as Web Action**.

Now, users can reach the action from a browser or cURL request, for example:
```curl
curl https://openwhisk.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/aaron.m.liberatore_dev/MyPackage/helloWorld.json?name=aaron
```
{: codeblock}

Output:
```json
{
    message: "Hello aaron!"
}
```
{: screen}

### SDK
{: #sdk}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} provides a [mobile SDK](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdk) for iOS and watchOS devices that enables mobile apps to easily send remote triggers and invoke remote actions.
