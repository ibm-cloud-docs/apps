# {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}} {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} events
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}

Activity Tracker records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions, and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can receive alerts about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.

There are currently two Activity Tracker services that are available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. The {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}} sends events to both services, and you can use either service to monitor the activity of the {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}. However, the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull}} is deprecated. No new instances can be created, and support for existing service instances is available only through 30 September 2019.

For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.at_full}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started) and [{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull}}](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker?topic=cloud-activity-tracker-getting-started).

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}} service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2).
